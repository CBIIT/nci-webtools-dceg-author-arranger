    <p>
      AuthorArranger is a free web tool designed to help authors of research manuscripts automatically generate correctly formatted title pages for manuscript journal submission in a fraction of the time it takes to create the pages manually. Whether your manuscript has 20 authors or 200, AuthorArranger can save you time and resources by helping you conquer journal title pages in seconds.
    </p>

    <p>
      Simply upload a spreadsheet containing author details ordered by author contribution, or download AuthorArranger’s easy-to-follow spreadsheet template and populate it with author and affiliation details. Either way, once your author information is uploaded AuthorArranger will allow you to make format choices based on the submission rules of the journal. When finished, you get a downloadable and formatted document that has all your authors and affiliations arranged for journal submission.
