    AuthorArranger Help</h2>

<p>AuthorArranger aims to make title pages with hundreds of authors a breeze. Simply upload a spreadsheet or text file containing
    author information, configure a journal format and leave AuthorArranger to do the heavy lifting. The result: a downloadable
    and formatted document that has all your authors and affiliations arranged in the order you uploaded them.</p>

<p>
    To get started, download the
    <a href="assets/files/AuthorArranger Template.xlsx">template</a> and populate the Authors tab with details about each author. Not all fields are required; just the ones
    you plan to use. If your author affiliation details are in an existing spreadsheet or text file, simply upload the file
    and manually select the columns in the file which correspond to fields AuthorArranger recognizes. If your workbook contains
    more than one spreadsheet, AuthorArranger will use the sheet titled Authors. For authors with multiple affiliations or
    titles, AuthorArranger requires these to be separated by a semicolon.
</p>

<p>
    After uploading the author information file, a formatted list of authors and their affiliations will be generated in the
    preview pane. Authors in this list will appear in the same order as they are in the uploaded author information file.
    AuthorArranger provides a variety of formatting options to facilitate submissions to different journals. Reordering of
    author details and the selection of different formatting options will automatically be displayed in the Preview pane.
    To omit a particular field from the generated output, simply select the "No data" option for that field. When you have
    created a style matching the journal cover page style, text in the Preview pane can be copied and pasted into your manuscript
    or downloaded in a document file for later use.
