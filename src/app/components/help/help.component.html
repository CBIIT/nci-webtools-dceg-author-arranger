<p>AuthorArranger helps its users save time when creating journal title pages consisting of many authors. To use this tool,
  download the <a href="assets/files/AuthorArranger Template.xlsx">template</a> and populate the Authors tab with details about each contributor. </p>

<p>
  After uploading the file, a formatted list of authors and their affiliations will be generated in the preview pane. The authors
  in this list will appear in the same order as they are in the input file.
</p>

<p>
  Users may also use their own workbooks or csv files and manually select the columns in the file which correspond to fields
  which AuthorArranger recognizes.
</p>

<p>
  To facilitate submission to different journals, AuthorArranger provides a variety of formatting options. To omit a particular
  field from the generated output, users may select the "No data" option for that field.
